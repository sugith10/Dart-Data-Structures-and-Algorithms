/// Getting the Length of a String
///
/// The `length` property in Dart is used to retrieve the number of characters in a string.
/// It provides the length of the string, counting each character, including spaces and punctuation.
///
/// Example:

void main() {
  String str = "Hello, Dart!";
  
  int length = str.length;

  print(length); // Output: 12
}
